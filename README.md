```

And then execute:

```console
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```console
gem install toggl-jobcan
```

## Configuration

Prepare `~/.toggl` including Toggl API token so that [Toggl::Worktime](https://github.com/limitusus/toggl-worktime) works.

Prepare `~/.toggl_worktime` for [Toggl::Worktime](https://github.com/limitusus/toggl-worktime) (Path can be specified via `-c` option).

Prepare `~/.jobcan` YAML file that includes:

From v0.3.0 you need to specify *Jobcan ID*, not *Jobcan Attendance ID*. For details read the [documentation by Jobcan](https://jobcanwf.zendesk.com/hc/ja/articles/224910508).

password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

## Usage

Pass date strings in `%Y%m%d` format.

```console
toggl-jobcan 20170201 20170202
```

To synchronise all days in a month, utilise `seq` command:

toggl-jobcan `seq -f '201702%02g' 1 28`
```

You can simulate the inputs with `--dryrun` option.
